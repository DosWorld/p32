Buglist and Todo list
---------------------

Compiler:
- Precalculate expressions like: a:=120+10+10+10;
- Improve support for objects
- Fix code generation for writeln('');
- P32 will run out of register with complex expressions
- Add correct assembler, linker executing
- Nested WITH's cause problems
- Add option to unroll loops
- Add LongBoolean type
- Add extended FOR loop, floating point counter, step indicator.

RTL (Extended DOS):
- Add missing functions


RTL (Win32):


IDE:

- OK buttons should have a focus, so pressing [Enter] is enough to activate
  them
- File open/save dialog is missing a 'scroll button'
- When block-highlight occurs on the first line of the source file it's 
  disabled
- ASCII Table has rather silly colours, better use the colour of EditWindow,
  layout could be better...
- Add checkmark which indicates if a option is enabled/disabled.
- Use keyword-structure from P32_SCAN.PAS for keyword highlighting


Wishlist
--------

Compiler:

- Support for sets
- Support for objects
- 64 bit integer type
- LongString type (allowing 4 Gig strings ;) )
- Include source in the asm source
- Include comments also in the asm source
- Partly useless, but rarely useful
  IfR (exp) then ... (If RARE) 
  e.g. with {$RARE} {$ENDRARE}

IDE:

- calculator (decimal/binary/hex) with 'insert result' option
- Option to insert current time/date
- Some wizards, like:
  . Source beautifier
  . Comment remover
  . Unit creator/updater (add all procedure/function to the interface part)
  . Insert binary as typed constant
- INI entry for highlight attributes
- Support for templates, with one default template.
- Auto-idention
- P32 supports nested comments, when nested comments are enabled, the IDE 
  should color them right.
- Select target option (maybe even a Add target...with some macro-expansion)
- Create IDE-options window, where all options (highlighting, etc.) can be set
