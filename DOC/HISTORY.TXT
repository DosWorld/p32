--------------

Version 0.5a1 [06 Oct 1998]
- Assembler parser rewritten
- Completed support for 'inline' (or macro) procedures/functions
- Optimized variable pushing
- Added a lot of lowlevel optimizations
- The lowlevel optimizer is run by default now
- Fixed bug in type conversion
- Fixed serious bug in CASE-statement (Thanks Armin!)
- Added support for local typed constants
- Text file I/O is buffered now
- The heapsize can be specified with the compiler directive {$M <heapsize}

  point numbers is not yet supported
- Added '-B' to rebuild all source files
- Nested procedure should work now...

- Enhanced NASM compatibility
- Improved the symboltable routines for flexibility, needed for objects

Version 0.5a2 [12 Oct 1998]
- Fixed bug in WITH-statement
- Added support for record-type constants
- Added -Dh option, this enable hints, currently only reports unused global
  variables.
- Only used external definitions are emitted now
- Better local symbol support for units

Version 0.5a3 [12 Oct 1998]
- Added support for enumerated constants
- Fixed small bug in unit compilation
- Fixed bug in comparisons of booleans
- Added basic support for DB/DW/DD in inline assembler blocks
- Function results are aligned on the stack
- Major bug, integer divides containing a multiple of two were incorrectly
  emitted. Fixed.
- Fixed destroying of value in EDX by port accesses.

Version 0.5a4 [25 Nov 1998]
- Added support for typed boolean, pointer and real constants
- Added stackframe alignment option, for the real speed freaks ;) (use -As)
- Improved commandline option handling
- Added commandline option for setting the heapsize
- Fixed bug in char comparison
- STRINGS.PAS added, by Pasquale Morvillo, pamorv@freenet.hut.fi
- Fixed bug in SUCC/PRED functions
- Optimized code generation for DIV
- Fixed some bugs in the lowlevel optimizer
- LENGTH is now an internal function

Version 0.5a5 [11 Jan 1999]
- Added support for MMX and 3DNow! instructions in the inline assembler.
- Added MemAvail to system unit
- Added supported in inline assembler for REP, REPNE, REPE <string opcode>
  on a single line.
- Fixed serious bug in DIV code generation
- Optimized code generation for floating point numbers
- Improved object support
- Added support for units that don't have a initialization part
- Fixed some bugs regarding to PORT arrays
- Added new option, register shuffling, improves the execution speed on
  Pentium alike CPUs. (use -Cr at the commandline)
- Added branch remover, thanks to Pawel Tanski! (Only on CMOV enabled CPU's)

Version 0.5a6 [20 Feb 1999]
- Fixed bug in floating point code generation
- Fixed code generator bug in CASE statement
- Some updates to the branch remover, tnx Pawel
- Added advanced, direct, pointer definitions, 
  like: var p    : ^array[0..5] of byte;
            point: ^record x,y,z: byte; end;
- Added $IFNDEF compiler directive, thanks to Philip.
- Added support for include files, through $I <file>, thanks to Philip.
- Added support for procedural variables
- Improved the lowlevel optimizer
- Win32 support is working again

Version 0.5b1 [17 Apr 1999]
- Completely rewritten the preprocessor, handles $IFDEF, $IFNDEF, $ELSE,
  $DEFINE, $UNDEF, $IFOPT. Even nesting of ifdef's is possible!
  Give a big hand to Pedro Gimeno ;)
- Completely rewritten the comment scanning, it now supports:
  { }, (* *), /* */, //, --. The comments can be nested and doesn't interfere
  with eachother... Yet again, many thanks to Pedro!
- Added ADDR() to the system unit
- Improved the unit handling and added support for expressions like:
  <unit>.<identifier>
- Fixed a big in the floating point code generation
- Enhanced type checking on procedure calls
- Fixed small type conversion bug
- Fixed some bugs related to the use of shuffled registers

Version 0.5b2 [2 Jul 1999]
- Improved support for objects, added support for 'INHERITED', also fixed
  the support for inheritance.
- Changed some keywords to standard directives
- Added support for register (fastcall) calling conventions, enable it with
  the procedure directive 'REGISTER'.
- Fixed bug in ARCTAN function
- Changed SQRT/SIN/COS/ARCTAN functions to inline functions
- Enhanced register allocation somewhat
- Fixed bug with automatic type conversion and parameters for procedures
- Code generator now outputs hexadecimal numbers, disable it with '-Dd'.
- Started a new optimizer: common subexpression elimination (CSE)
