
Just in case you're to lazy to write some DPMI function wrappers on your own.
.obj included if you don't like to deal with assembly at all.

Fortunately you can find DOS protected mode C routines all over the net, so
you don't really want me to include yet a "Hello world" example and stuff like
this, do you?
